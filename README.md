# You can now play as Gabbro

Features:
- Spawn on GD with your ship
- Spawn hatchling on TH
- Altered the first loop

Plans:
- Change traveler dialogue to refer to you as Gabbro
  - A lot of dialogue is very Hatchling specific as well, might have to just change everything
- Add dialogue with the Hatchling
  - Needs specific dialogue as well for the first loop, and for the first time you speak to them after dying
- Change the interaction with Self (or at least just the model)
